# The Swift Index

The Swift Index will be a website that contains all of Taylor Swift's songs. Each song will have an overall rating alongside multiple other fun metrics. Users will be able to contribute their own ratings and opinions of each song with the hope of building an index that best represents each track.

## Purpose

My purpose in building this is to practice my knowledge of React, Node and PostgreSQL. Also, I love her music and would like to see how other people feel about every one of her songs.
